Data Structures and Algorithms

The following files are from an academic course I was in, which focused on data structures and algorithms in Java. 

Course Description:
Fundamental algorithms and data structures for implementation. Techniques for solving problems by programming. Linked lists, stacks, queues, directed graphs. Trees: representations, traversals. Searching (hashing, binary search trees, multiway trees). Garbage collection, memory management. Internal and external sorting.

Main:
The main folder includes the implementations of the data structures we learned about in class, including the array heap, double linked list and key-value pairs. Each data structure uses specific interfaces that lay the structures for the more specific data structures' implementations.

Test:
The test folder includes files used to test the data structures implemented in the class. The testing is implemented using JUnit Testing. 

Reflection:
Through this course, I was able to learn much more in-depth information about data structures and algorithms. By implementing the data structures that we learned about in class, I was able to understand the complexity of creating data structures that you can modify to fit specific needs that may appear in specific uses.
